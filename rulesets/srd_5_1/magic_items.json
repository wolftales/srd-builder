        "Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-\u00ad\u2010\u2011dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image. Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features\u2014such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons\u2014that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create. Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material. If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything."

        "When this 4-\u00ad\u2010\u2011foot-\u00ad\u2010\u2011tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again. Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror\u2019s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror\u2019s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically. An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror\u2019s cells don\u2019t age, and they don\u2019t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror\u2019s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally. In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature"

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slot."

Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-\u00ad\u2010\u2011aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side. Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient. Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM\u2019s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item\u2019s control, not its wielder\u2019s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder. Creating Sentient Magic Items When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item\u2019s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here."

        "Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic. As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons. Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb. An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb\u2019s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. While you are charmed by the orb, you can\u2019t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the"

The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag. Alignment A monster\u2019s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the alignments. The alignment specified in a monster\u2019s stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster\u2019s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-\u00ad\u2010\u2011aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, there\u2019s nothing stopping you. Some creatures can have any alignment. In other words, you choose the monster\u2019s alignment. Some monster\u2019s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature. Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don\u2019t make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are unaligned, which means they don\u2019t have an alignment. Armor Class A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster\u2019s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value. Hit Points A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see the A monster\u2019s hit points are presented both as a die expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 \u00d7 4\u00bd). A monster\u2019s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table."

        "A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the for any cantrips included in the feature. The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires membership in the class or access to its spell list. A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a cast it as a 5th-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell by using one of its 5th-\u00ad\u2010\u2011level spell slots. You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on its spell list with a spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating."

You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow. Reactions If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is Limited Usage Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used. X/Day. The notation \u201cX/Day\u201d means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, \u201c1/Day\u201d means a special ability can be used once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again. Recharge X\u2013Y. The notation \u201cRecharge X\u2013Y\u201d means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster\u2019s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest. For example, \u201cRecharge 5\u20136\u201d means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster\u2019s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6. Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again. Grapple Rules for Monsters Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn\u2019t need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack says otherwise. A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster\u2019s stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster\u2019s Strength (Athletics) modifier. Equipment A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately."
