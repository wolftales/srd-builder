"""Test cross-page monster extraction.

This test suite prevents regression of the cross-page monster bug fixed in commit 7abeb74.
Before the fix, monsters spanning page boundaries were truncated (e.g., Deva had only 28 blocks).
After the fix, all monsters have complete stat blocks regardless of page breaks.
