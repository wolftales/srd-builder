# srd-builder

**srd-builder** is a reproducible extraction and normalization pipeline for the *System Reference Document* (SRD) rulesets — starting with **D&D 5.1** and expanding to **5.2.1 (2024)** and beyond.

It builds structured, license-compliant datasets directly from the official PDF releases under *Creative Commons BY 4.0*, producing clean, machine-readable outputs such as:

- `monsters.json`
- `equipment.json`
- `spells.json`
- `rules.json`
- `index.json`

Future outputs may include **YAML**, **SQLite**, or **Parquet** formats.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/wolftales/srd-builder.git
cd srd-builder

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build SRD 5.1 (PDF must be placed in rulesets/srd_5_1/raw/)
python scripts/build.py --ruleset srd_5_1 --out rulesets/srd_5_1/data

# Validate and inspect
python scripts/validate.py --ruleset srd_5_1
python scripts/diff_report.py --a srd_5_1 --b srd_5_2_1

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome!
Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and ensure that:

* You do **not** commit SRD PDFs.
* All code passes `pytest` and `validate.py`.
* JSON outputs remain deterministic across runs.

---

## Inspiration

Born out of the need for *structured, open, and rebuildable SRD data* — powering solo play engines, virtual tabletops, and AI-assisted narrative systems.
