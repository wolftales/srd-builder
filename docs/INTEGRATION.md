# Blackmoor Integration Strategy

## Producer-Consumer Relationship

### **The Vision: Separation of Concerns**

srd-builder was created to **remove data processing burden from Blackmoor**, allowing Blackmoor to focus purely on game logic and usage. The project was bootstrapped collaboratively with Blackmoor to define the specification and ensure alignment with their consumption needs.

**srd-builder** (Producer/Upstream)
- **Role:** Data extraction and processing specialist
- Extracts structured data directly from SRD 5.1 PDF
- Produces clean, validated JSON data files
- Maintains schemas and metadata
- Version controlled, tested, reproducible
- Implements the spec Blackmoor needs

**Blackmoor** (Consumer/Downstream)
- **Role:** Game framework and application logic
- Defined the data specification and structure requirements
- Integrates srd-builder's data files into game framework
- Focuses on game mechanics, not data extraction
- Consumes: data files, schemas, indexes, metadata
- No longer needs to maintain extraction pipeline

## Data Package Structure

srd-builder currently produces the following files for Blackmoor consumption:

```
dist/srd_5_1/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ monsters.json         # 296 monsters with structured fields
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.json            # Lookup tables (by_name, by_cr, by_type, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ build_report.json         # Build metadata and version info
â””â”€â”€ [schemas TBD]             # JSON schemas for validation
```

## What We Provide vs What They Need

### âœ… Currently Available (v0.4.1)
- **data/monsters.json**: 296 monsters with structured AC/HP/Speed
- **data/index.json**: Rich indexes (name, CR, type, size)
- **build_report.json**: Build metadata and versioning
- **schemas/monster.schema.json**: Validation schema

### ðŸ”„ Data Improvements Over Blackmoor
1. **+95 more monsters** (296 vs 201)
2. **Structured AC**: `{"value": 17, "source": "natural armor"}` vs simple `17`
3. **Structured HP**: `{"average": 135, "formula": "18d10+36"}` vs separate fields
4. **Speed conditions**: Preserves `(hover)` and other modifiers
5. **Direct PDF extraction**: Reproducible, version-controlled pipeline

### ðŸ“‹ Future Content Types (Weeks 2-6)
Following Blackmoor's roadmap, srd-builder will expand to extract:
- Week 2: Equipment (weapons, armor, gear)
- Week 3-4: Classes & Lineages
- Week 5: Spells & Features
- Week 6: Conditions, Rules, Tables

Each content type will follow the same pattern:
```
dist/srd_5_1/
â””â”€â”€ data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ monsters.json     # âœ… v0.4.1
    â”œâ”€â”€ equipment.json    # ðŸ”„ Week 2
    â”œâ”€â”€ classes.json      # ðŸ”„ Week 3-4
    â”œâ”€â”€ spells.json       # ðŸ”„ Week 5
    â”œâ”€â”€ conditions.json   # ðŸ”„ Week 6
    â””â”€â”€ index.json        # Updated with all content types
```

## Integration Workflow

### For Blackmoor (Consumer)
1. Pull latest srd-builder release
2. Copy `dist/srd_5_1/data/*` â†’ Blackmoor data directory
3. Use `schemas/` for validation if needed
4. Reference `build_report.json` for versioning/metadata

### For srd-builder (Producer)
1. Extract content from SRD PDF
2. Normalize and structure data
3. Validate against schema
4. Generate indexes
5. Tag release
6. Blackmoor pulls the release

## File Format Compatibility

### Naming Convention
Both projects use three-level naming:
- `id`: "monster:aboleth" (stable identifier)
- `simple_name`: "aboleth" (machine-readable)
- `name`: "Aboleth" (display name)

### Field Structure
srd-builder provides RICHER data that Blackmoor can either:
- **Use directly**: Consume structured AC/HP/Speed as-is
- **Flatten**: Convert `{"value": 17, "source": "..."}` â†’ `17` if needed

No data loss - Blackmoor can always extract the simple value from our structured format.

## Current vs Target State

### Current (v0.4.1)
```
srd-builder â†’ [monsters.json, index.json, schemas] â†’ Blackmoor
  296 monsters                                          201 monsters
  Structured fields                                     Simple fields
```

### Target (v1.0)
```
srd-builder â†’ [full SRD data + schemas] â†’ Blackmoor
  - Monsters (296) âœ…
  - Equipment (TBD)
  - Classes (TBD)
  - Spells (TBD)
  - Conditions/Rules/Tables (TBD)
```

## Design Philosophy

### **Collaborative Spec, Focused Execution**

- **Blackmoor defines the spec**: Field names, structure, what data is needed
- **srd-builder implements extraction**: PDF parsing, normalization, validation
- **Result**: Clean separation allows each project to excel at its specialty

### **Data Enrichment Strategy**

We provide **richer** data than strictly required:
- Structured fields (AC with sources, HP with formulas) can be flattened if needed
- Additional indexes and metadata available but optional
- Backwards compatible: consumers can ignore enrichments and use simple values

This approach:
- âœ… **No lock-in**: Blackmoor can use as much or as little structure as needed
- âœ… **Future-proof**: New use cases can leverage richer data without re-extraction
- âœ… **No data loss**: Flattening is always possible, but original detail preserved

## Open Questions

1. Should we maintain Blackmoor's exact field structure, or provide structured fields they can flatten?
   - **Recommendation**: Provide structured, they flatten if needed (no data loss)
   - **Status**: Implemented in v0.4.0 - structured fields with backwards compatibility

2. Do they need additional index types beyond name/CR/type/size?
   - Current indexes cover common lookups
   - **Action**: Check with Blackmoor if additional indexes needed (alignment, environment, etc.)

3. Should build_report.json include extraction statistics (warnings, coverage)?
   - Currently minimal, can expand if useful
   - **Action**: Discuss what metadata would be valuable for debugging/validation

4. File naming: `monsters.json` vs `monster.json`?
   - Currently plural, matches collection semantics
   - **Status**: Confirmed plural convention
