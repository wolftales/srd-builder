# Parking Lot - Deferred Features

This document tracks features that have been discussed but deferred for later implementation.

## terminology.aliases Field in meta.json

**Status:** Deferred until second ruleset or naming conflict

### Intent
Help consumers find content when terminology differs between rulesets or versions. Provides a mapping from alternative terms to the canonical names used in this dataset.

### Example from Blackmoor
```json
"terminology": {
  "aliases": {
    "races": "lineages",
    "race": "lineage"
  },
  "note": "We use 'lineage' terminology to be future-proof and align with modern D&D direction."
}
```

### Context
- **Historical:** Originally `races/` directories were planned (README_v1.md)
- **Evolution:** Changed to `lineages.json` for future-proofing (README_v2.md)
- **Rationale:** Different game systems or SRD versions might use different terminology
- **Example:** D&D 5e uses "race", but newer editions might prefer "lineage" or "ancestry"

### Open Questions

1. **Scope:** Is this for top-level file names only, or also field names within data structures?
   - Example: Should it map `monster.race` → `monster.lineage`?
   - Or just `races.json` → `lineages.json`?

2. **Direction:** Which way should the mapping go?
   - Option A: Old → New (`races` → `lineages`) - "if you're looking for races, check lineages"
   - Option B: New → Old (`lineages` → `races`) - "we call it lineages, you might know it as races"
   - Blackmoor uses Option A

3. **Per-Ruleset vs Global:**
   - Should each ruleset have its own aliases?
   - Or should this be a global srd-builder convention?
   - SRD 5.1 specifically uses "classes" and "races" terminology in the source PDF
   - Other systems might differ

4. **When to Add:**
   - Add now as empty placeholder?
   - Add when we extract a second ruleset with different terminology?
   - Add when we actually encounter a naming conflict?

5. **Consumer Behavior:**
   - How should consumers use this? Auto-redirects? Documentation only?
   - Should we provide utility functions to resolve aliases?

### Decision Point
Implement when:
- We extract a second ruleset with different terminology, OR
- We identify an actual naming conflict that affects consumers, OR
- A consumer specifically requests this feature

- `docs/external/blackmoor/README_v2.md` - Updated structure with `lineages.json`

### Implementation Checklist (When Triggered)
- [ ] Decide on alias direction and scope
- [ ] Update `_generate_meta_json()` in `build.py`
- [ ] Add schema validation for terminology section
- [ ] Document usage in README
- [ ] Consider adding to TEMPLATE files
- [ ] Update tests to verify alias structure
