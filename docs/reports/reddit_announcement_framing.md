## Reddit Announcement Framing

When you hit v1.0, position it as:

**"SRD-Builder v1.0: Reproducible D&D 5e SRD datasets with source provenance"**

Tagline: "Every stat block traceable to SRD page numbers. Offline-first. Git-friendly. MIT licensed."

#### Hook for devs:
* Deterministic builds (same PDF → same JSON hash)
* No server setup (just JSON files)
* Page number citations for every entry
* JSON Schema validated

#### Use cases:
* Solo gaming engines
* Academic research
* Legal-compliant VTTs
* Offline reference apps

This positions you not as **"yet another D&D API"** but as **"the auditable source-of-truth dataset"** - which none of the others can claim.
